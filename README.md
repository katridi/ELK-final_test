# Task description

## - Index movie lens content to Elasticsearch
[movie content](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m-README.html) (movies.csv, ratings.csv, tags.csv)

You could use any way to index data:
- Logstash (csv input, ... )
- Java/Python/C# â€“ Elastic client -> indexing

## - Write console application which search movies

- match phrase (https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/search_dsl.html#more-like-this-query)
- fuzzy
- filter/sort by average rating
- finding top-10 tags for the movie <b>(DONE)</b>
- find movies which userX is put rating of 5). <b>(DONE)</b>

### NB: Try implement it using several approaches for working with hierarchical data and explain which one is the best fit here
